## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Node Sass

### Useful resources

- Kevin Powell's [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/KepowOb) and Conquering Responsive Layouts [Course](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts)- Pretty much any video Kevin has on responsive layouts and sass, I love it! In this project (after watching some of his videos) I tried not to use the **height** property and also not use absolute units for the **width** of components.
- I absolutely love these [Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es/) written by [Kitty Giraudel](https://kittygiraudel.com/), specially the section on [Architecture](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture). It inspired me to be more organized with my projects and create good habits.
